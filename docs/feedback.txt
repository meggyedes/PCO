Feedback from Joshua van Avessath
Joshua said that the website looks good overall, but some elements needed fine-tuning. His main concern was with the colors in a few transitions, where certain parts disappeared or were not clearly visible. I have already improved this by using more contrasting and cleaner colors.
He also mentioned that while he really likes the clean design, it is still missing a bit of a "WOW factor." This could be achieved by adding stronger colors, unique elements, or stylish details.
Joshua noted that, based on what he saw, I seem experienced in coding and web development, and that this is a very good foundation. At the same time, he pointed out that there is still room for me to grow and improve. He praised the clarity of the design and the professional implementation.
On paper, he also wrote: "You really motivated me to work hard on my website."

Feedback from Thymo van der Klooster
Thymo said that the website looks very professional and clean. He liked the overall design and the way the content is presented. He also mentioned that the navigation is intuitive, making it easy for users to find what they are looking for.
At the same time, he pointed out that I should make sure each page contains all the necessary information, since not all of my blog posts were finished at that time. Since then, I have completed most of them and improved their condition.
Thymo also advised me to keep my code easily readable and maintainable, as this is important for future updates and changes to the website. I have already improved this by adding comments and organizing my code more clearly.


Feedback from Anastasia Stylianou
Anastasia said that she really liked the clean and professional design of the website. She mentioned that the layout is well-structured, which makes it easy to navigate between different sections. She also appreciated the choice of colors and fonts, as they improve the overall aesthetic appeal. In her opinion, it even looks similar to the HZ website, which she considered a positive point.
Her main suggestion was to edit the dashboard with actual information and data. However, since I currently do not have any real data, I left it as it is for now. In the future, I plan to make it possible to update data directly from the website itself. To achieve this, I would need to use PHP and Laravel. At the moment, I could not have implemented this properly within the given timeframe, since it would have required building the project from the start with that structure in mind.
Still, this is part of my future plan, because storing such data in a database and loading it dynamically (for example, in the tables) would be a much better solution.
