                  Choosing a study program is one of the most important
                  decisions in life. Here's my journey of discovering my passion
                  for technology and why the ICT program at HZ University was

                <h2>The Spark of Interest</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  My interest in technology started when I was young. I remember
                  being fascinated by how computers work, how websites are
                  created, and how mobile apps can solve real problems. My
                  grandparents were both programmers a long time ago. My
                  grandmother often told me stories about the exciting projects
                  they worked on, and my grandfather shared many stories about
                  his programming career when I was little. What began as
                  curiosity slowly grew into a real passion for understanding
                  and creating digital solutions.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  During secondary school, I had my first chance to learn about
                  programming in a computer science class. Writing my first
                  "Hello World" program might seem simple to many people, but
                  for me, it was a very important moment. Being able to tell a
                  computer what to do and see the result immediately felt very
                  exciting and powerful. I realized that I had found something
                  special.
                </p>

                <h2>Exploring My Options</h2>
                <p >
                  When it came time to choose a study program, I researched
                  various options in the technology field. I considered:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Computer Science at University:</strong> More
                    theoretical and research-focused
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Software Engineering:</strong> Highly specialized in
                    programming
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>HBO-ICT:</strong> Practical, industry-focused with
                    broad ICT knowledge
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Applied Sciences:</strong> Hands-on approach with
                    real-world applications
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why HBO-ICT at HZ University?</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  After thorough research and thinking, I found many strong
                  reasons why HBO-ICT at HZ University is the perfect choice for
                  me. This program offers a balanced mix of practical
                  experience, theoretical knowledge, and personal development
                  that prepares students well for the fast-changing world of
                  ICT.
                </p>

                <h3>1. Practical, Hands-On Learning</h3>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  The HBO-ICT program focuses strongly on practical skills and
                  real-world projects. Instead of only reading about theory,
                  students get to work on assignments that are very close to
                  actual problems faced by companies today. This means I can
                  gain real experience and learn how to solve problems in a
                  professional way. The program uses real clients and projects
                  from local and international partners, which gives me a real
                  taste of what working in ICT is like.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  Additionally, the program encourages agile working methods.
                  This means working flexibly with a team, adjusting goals as
                  needed, and focusing on delivering results in small,
                  manageable steps. This approach helps students develop
                  teamwork skills and learn how to manage projects efficiently —
                  skills important for any ICT professional.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Strong Industry Connections</h3>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  HZ University has excellent partnerships with a wide range of
                  companies both locally and internationally. These connections
                  create many opportunities for internships, guest lectures from
                  industry experts, and potential job offers after graduation.
                  The university organizes events and workshops where students
                  can meet professionals and learn about the latest trends in
                  technology. This close relationship between education and
                  industry ensures that students stay up-to-date with rapidly
                  evolving ICT developments.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  Furthermore, students can often work on real business
                  challenges as part of their assignments. Being exposed to
                  these challenges early helps build confidence and valuable
                  experience that companies look for in future employees.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  Students can choose specializations in the later years, such
                  as Software Engineering, Data Science, or Business IT
                  Consulting, allowing them to pursue their interests and career
                  goals more closely.
                </p>

                <h3>4. International and Diverse Learning Environment</h3>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  HZ University attracts students from many countries, creating
                  a diverse and international learning atmosphere. This is very
                  valuable in the global ICT industry, where working with people
                  from different cultures is common. This environment encourages
                  understanding and collaboration between students from
                  different backgrounds, preparing them for the multicultural
                  workplaces they will enter after graduation.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  Additionally, courses and projects often include international
                  perspectives and teamwork, which helps students build skills
                  relevant to global markets. This international focus shows HZ
                  University’s commitment to not just teaching technology but
                  also developing global citizens ready for the future.
                </p>
