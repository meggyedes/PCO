                            <h2>What is a SWOT Analysis?</h2>
                            <p>SWOT analysis is a strategic planning technique used to evaluate Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. While typically used in business contexts, it's equally valuable for personal development and career planning. By honestly assessing these four areas, I can better understand my current position and plan for future growth.</p>

                            <h2>Deep Dive: My Strengths</h2>
                            <p>Understanding my strengths helps me leverage them effectively in my studies and future career:</p>
                            
                            <h3>Logical Thinking and Problem-Solving</h3>
                            <p>I've always enjoyed puzzles and logical challenges. This natural inclination towards systematic thinking serves me well in programming, where breaking down complex problems into manageable steps is essential. During high school mathematics and physics, I consistently excelled at analytical problems.</p>

                            <h3>Learning Agility</h3>
                            <p>I adapt quickly to new technologies and concepts. When I first encountered HTML and CSS, I was able to create a basic website within a week of self-study. This ability to rapidly absorb new information will be crucial in the fast-evolving ICT field.</p>

                            <h3>Persistence and Determination</h3>
                            <p>When I encounter challenges, I don't give up easily. I remember spending hours debugging my first JavaScript program, but the satisfaction of finally solving the problem reinforced my passion for programming. This persistence will be valuable during challenging coursework and complex projects.</p>

                            <h2>Acknowledging My Weaknesses</h2>
                            <p>Recognizing weaknesses is the first step toward improvement:</p>

                            <h3>Limited Professional Experience</h3>
                            <p>As a student, I lack real-world industry experience. While I've worked on personal projects, I haven't yet experienced the pressures and complexities of professional software development. This is something I plan to address through internships and collaborative projects.</p>

                            <h3>Perfectionism</h3>
                            <p>While attention to detail is valuable, my perfectionist tendencies sometimes slow my progress. I need to learn when "good enough" is sufficient and when to iterate rather than perfect from the start. This is particularly important in agile development environments.</p>

                            <h3>Time Management</h3>
                            <p>Balancing multiple courses, assignments, and personal projects requires better time management skills. I'm working on implementing productivity techniques and using project management tools to improve in this area.</p>

                            <h2>Exciting Opportunities Ahead</h2>
                            <p>The ICT field offers numerous opportunities for growth and development:</p>

                            <h3>Industry Growth and Demand</h3>
