                  Over a decade ago, I took my first steps into the world of programming as a curious 
                  elementary school student. What began as weekend sessions learning Scratch has evolved 
                  into a comprehensive journey through the Hungarian education system and now to the 
                  Netherlands, where I'm pursuing modern ICT education at HZ University. This is the 
                  story of my programming evolution, the skills I've gained, and the passion that

                <h2>The Beginning: LogiSchool and Weekend Adventures</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  My programming journey began in elementary school when my siblings and I started 
                  attending LogiSchool on weekends. These weren't just casual computer classes – 
                  they were intensive 4-hour programming sessions that would shape my future in 
                  ways I couldn't have imagined at the time.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  We started with Scratch, the visual programming language designed to introduce 
                  children to coding concepts. I remember the excitement of dragging and dropping 
                  colorful blocks to create animations and simple games. What seemed like play 
                  was actually building the foundation of logical thinking and problem-solving 
                  skills that would prove invaluable later.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  After about 1-2 years of Scratch, we progressed to actual coding. The transition 
                  from visual blocks to text-based programming was challenging but thrilling. 
                  Suddenly, we were writing real code and creating Android applications that could 
                  be downloaded and used by others. The moment I saw my first app running on a 
                  phone was magical – I had created something tangible from lines of code.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  Those weekend sessions at LogiSchool weren't just about learning syntax or 
                  memorizing commands. They were about discovering a passion. I found myself 
                  looking forward to weekends not for cartoons or games, but for the opportunity 
                  to solve puzzles, create something new, and push the boundaries of what I could 
                  build with code.
                </p>

                <h2>Secondary School: Building a Professional Foundation</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  When it came time to choose a secondary school, my path was clear. I enrolled 
                  in the ICT program at Bláthy Ottó Titusz Budapest, a decision that would 
                  transform my hobby into a professional skill set. Within this program, I 
                  specialized in Software Development and Testing, diving deep into the 
                  theoretical and practical aspects of software engineering.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  The program was comprehensive and demanding. Unlike the exploratory nature of 
                  my elementary school programming, this was structured, professional education. 
                  We learned not just how to code, but how to code well – following best practices, 
                  understanding design patterns, and thinking about software architecture from 
                  the ground up.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  Upon completing the program, I obtained a professional certification that 
                  validated my skills and knowledge. But more importantly, I had developed a 
                  diverse technical foundation that would serve me well in my continued studies 
                  and future career aspirations.
                </p>

                <h3>Technical Skills Acquired</h3>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  During my time at Bláthy Ottó Titusz Budapest, I gained proficiency in a wide 
                  range of technologies and methodologies that form the backbone of modern software 
                  development:

                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  This diverse technical foundation wasn't just about learning individual technologies 
                  – it was about understanding how they work together to create comprehensive solutions. 
                  I learned to think in terms of full-stack development, considering everything from 
                  database design to user interface, from network architecture to testing strategies.
                </p>

                <h2>The Fleet Management System: A Major Achievement</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  One of the most significant projects during my secondary education was the development 
                  of a comprehensive fleet management system. This wasn't just a school assignment – 
                  it was a collaborative team project designed to solve real-world problems for small 
                  to medium-sized companies.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  The fleet management system we created was designed to help companies track their 
                  vehicles, manage maintenance schedules, monitor fuel consumption. Working as part of a development team, I experienced firsthand the 
                  challenges and rewards of collaborative software development.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  The project was a resounding success, demonstrating not only our technical skills 
                  but also our ability to work together, manage deadlines, and deliver a product 
                  that met real business needs. The system we built was robust, user-friendly, 
                  and scalable – qualities that would make it viable in the commercial market.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  In fact, the project was so successful that I have plans to develop it further 
                  into a market-ready product when time permits. The experience taught me that 
                  programming isn't just about writing code – it's about solving problems, 
                  creating value, and making a positive impact through technology.
                </p>

                <h2>The Transition: From Hungary to the Netherlands</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  After completing my secondary education in Hungary, I faced an important decision: 
                  where to continue my studies? While I had already gained substantial technical

                  As I continue my studies at HZ University and prepare for my future career in ICT, 
                  I carry with me the passion that was first ignited during those weekend sessions 
                  at LogiSchool. That curiosity and enthusiasm for technology continues to drive me 
                  forward, and I'm excited to see where this journey will take me next.

                  To fellow students who might be reading this: embrace every opportunity to learn, 
                  don't be afraid to take on challenging projects, and remember that every expert 
                  was once a beginner. The journey is just as important as the destination, and 
                  every line of code you write is a step forward in your own programming adventure.
